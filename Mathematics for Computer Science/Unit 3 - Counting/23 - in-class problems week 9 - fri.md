# In-Class Problems Week 9, Fri.

Questions available on [**MIT**](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/assets/courseware/v1/eabc76e9ecd3f7eda8d0e9dd0d2a4dc4/asset-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019+type@asset+block/MIT6_042JS15_cp23.pdf).

## Problem 1

* **a)** Describe a closed-form formula for the amount of wine in the first glass after $n$ back-and-forth pourings.

  * Open form
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{4^{i-1}}{3^{2i-1}} = \frac{3}{4} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)^i
    $$
    

  * Closed form
    $$
    \frac{3}{4}\left( \frac{1-(4/9)^{n+1}}{1-(4/9)} \right)-\frac{3}{4}
    $$
    or
    $$
    \frac{12-27(4/9)^{n+1}}{20}
    $$
    

* **b)** What is the limit of the amount of wine in each glass as $n$ approaches infinity?

  * Glass of water $= \frac{12}{20} = 0.6$

  * Glass of wine $= 0.4$
