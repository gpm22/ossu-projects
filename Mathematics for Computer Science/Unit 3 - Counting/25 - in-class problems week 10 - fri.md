## Problem 1

* **a)** How many of the billion numbers in the range from $1$ to $10^9$ contain the digit 1? (Hint: How many donâ€™t?)

  * Basically we have to sum the numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, ..., 9 digits which do not contain the digit 1 and then subtract that value from $10^9$.

  * This sum will be:
    $$
    & | \{2, \dots, 9 \}| + | \{2, \dots, 9 \}| \cdot | \{0, 2, \dots, 9 \}| + | \{2, \dots, 9 \}| \\
    & \cdot | \{0, 2, \dots, 9 \}|^2 + \dots + | \{2, \dots, 9 \}| \cdot | \{0, 2, \dots, 9 \}|^8  \\
     = &  | \{2, \dots, 9 \}| \left( 1 + | \{0, 2, \dots, 9 \}| + | \{0, 2, \dots, 9 \}|^2 + \dots +| \{0, 2, \dots, 9 \}|^8 \right )
    $$

  * This sum is a geometric sum, then:
    $$
    | \{2, \dots, 9 \}| \left( \frac{1-|\{0, 2, \dots, 9 \}|^9}{1-|\{0, 2, \dots, 9 \}|} \right) = 8\left( \frac{1-9^9}{1-9|} \right) =  9^9-1
    $$
    
  * Now the subtraction:
    $$
    10^9 - (9^9 - 1) = 10^9 - 9^9 + 1 = 612579512
    $$
    
  
* **b)** There are 20 books arranged in a row on a shelf. Describe a bijection between ways of choosing 6 of these books so that no two adjacent books are selected and 15-bit strings with exactly 6 ones.

  * First you create a 20-bit string, where the selected books are 1, as example:

    ```
    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

  * Second you transform each pair of zeros in one zero:

    ```
    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

  * If the result is not 15-length, eliminate a zero from trio of zeroes:

    ```
    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
    ```

## Problem 2

* **a)** Describe a procedure for reconstructing a numbered tree from its code;

  * First you look up for the number of the times each of the two remaining leaves appear in the code, that number will be numbers of leaves each remaining leave has. So we add theses leaves to the remaining leaves.
  * We know that the numbers that are missing in the code are just leaves.
  * We number the leaves from the from the biggest to the smallest.
  * After number a leaf, we eliminate its appearance in the code.
  * If there is a leaf in the  code which is not numbered yet, it means that it has a father and sons, so we add that leaf to leaf which appears after it in the code. Then we remove both from the code.
  * Then we number the other leaves and remove then from the code.

* **b)** Conclude there is a bijection between the $n$-vertex numbered trees and $\{ 1, \dots, n \} ^{n-2}$, and state how many $n$-vertex numbered trees there are.

  * A $n$-vertex numbered tree can be defined by its code solely.

  * The code is the a sequence of $n - 2$ integers from $1$ to  $n$.

  * The set $\{ 1, \dots, n \} ^{n-2}$ is the set of creating a sequence with $1, \dots, n$ with $n-2$ places, thenthe code is the bijection between the $n$-vertex numbered trees and this set.

  * Therefore the number of $n$-vertex numbered trees are:
    $$
    \{ 1, \dots, n \} ^{n-2} = |\{ 1, \dots, n \}| ^{n-2} = n^{n-2}
    $$

## Problem 3

* **a)** Describe a bijection between $S_{n, k} ::= \{ (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_ k) \in \N^k \ | \ \sum_{i=1}^k x_i \leq n \}$ and the set of binary strings with $n$ zeroes and $k$ ones.
  * $1 \to$ Represents the position of each $x_ k$.
  * $0 \to$ Represents the Natural number $x_k$, like 4 is $0000$.
    * In the case where $\sum_{i=1}^k x_i < n$, we put the remaining zeroes to the left.
* **b)** Describe a bijection between $S_{n, k}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{n, k} ::= \{ (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_ k) \in \N^k \ | \ y_1 \leq y_2 \leq \cdots \leq y_k \leq n \}$.
  * $k$ and $n$ is the same for both sets, therefore both $n$'s are already related.
  * Then we just sort the $x$'s so they will be in the same place as they respective $y$'s.

## Problem 4

Let $X$ and $Y$ be infinite sets.

* **a)** How many binary relations from $X$ to $Y$ are there?

  * Every binary relation of $X$ and $Y$ is a subset of $A \times B$, and there is $2^{|A \times B|}$ subsets, so the number of binary relations from $X$ to $Y$ is:
    $$
    2^{|A \times B|} =2^{|A| \cdot |B|}
    $$

* **b)** Define a bijection between the set $[ X \to Y ]$ of all total functions from $X$ to $Y$ and the set $Y^{|X|}$. Based on that, what is $|[X \to Y]|$?

  * Each total function will be related to one of the elements of $Y^{|X|}$, that is the bijection, just find the same value in both sets.
  * By the bijection rule: $|[X \to Y]| = |Y|^{|X|}$

* **c)** Using the previous part, how many functions, not necessarily total, are there from $X$ to $Y$? How does the fraction of functions vs. total functions grow as the size of $X$ grows? Is it $O(1), O(|X|), O(2^{|X|}), \dots$?

  * Number of functions from $X$ to $Y$:
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{|X|}|Y|^{i} = \frac{1-|Y|^{|X|+1}}{1-|Y|}
    $$
    

  * Growth of the fraction functions vs. total functions:
    $$
    \frac{\frac{1-|Y|^{|X|+1}}{1-|Y|}}{ \frac{|Y|^{|X|}}{1} } = \frac{|Y|^{2|X|+1}-|Y|^{|X|} }{|Y|-1} = \frac{|Y|^{|X|+1}-1 }{|Y|^{1-|X|}-|Y|^{-|X|}} \\ \\
    $$
    When $|X|$ and $|Y|$ grows large:
    $$
    |Y|^{|X|}
    $$
    Therefore $O(|Y|^{|X|})$.

* **d)** Show a bijection between the powerset, $\text{pow}(X)$, and the set $[ X \to \{ 0, 1 \}]$ of $0-1$-valued total functions on $X$.

  * The cardinality of each set in $\text{pow}(X)$ will be the sum of ones for each combination in $[ X \to \{ 0, 1 \}]$, when the cardinality is the same the relation is chosen by the numbers in the set in pow to be the ones in the $[ X \to \{ 0, 1 \}]$.

* **e)** Let $X$ be a set of size $n$ and $B_X$ be the set of all bijections from $X$ to $X$. Describe a bijection from $B_ X$ to the set of permutations of $X$. This implies that there are how may bijections from $X$ to $X$?

  * The bijection is the sequence of values of the codomain. There is one of each for each permutation, which means that each permutation will be the result of a bijection.
  * There is $n!$ bijections from $X$ to $X$.
