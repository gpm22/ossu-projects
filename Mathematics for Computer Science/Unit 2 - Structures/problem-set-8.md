## Problem 1

**Prove: "If all edges in a finite weighted graph have distinct weights, then the graph has a *unique* MST**.

We prove by contradiction that If all edges in a finite weighted graph have distinct weights, then the graph has a *unique* MST.

Lets assume that $M$ and $N$ are different MST's of the same graph, $e$ is the smallest edge of the graph and it is in $M$ but not in $N$, so $e \in M - N$.

Adding $e$ to $N$ will create a spanning graph with a cycle, as $e$ will connect vertices already connected. So there is an edge $f \in N - M$ that is weightier than $e$. So $N$ is weightier than $M$ and cannot be a MST, we arrived at a contradiction.
