# In-Class Problems Week 8, Wed.

Questions available on [**MIT**](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/assets/courseware/v1/3fe4ea512400d98130a87a16f52de982/asset-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019+type@asset+block/MIT6_042JS15_cp19.pdf).

## Problem 1

* **a)** Comment on the following claim. “Since we’re assuming that each encounter involves one man and one woman, the average numbers should be the same, so the males must be exaggerating.”

  * Totally false, as the average difference of encounters is proportional to ratio men/women;

* **b)** For what constant $c$ is $m = c \cdot f$?
  $$
  \text{avg}(M) m & = & \text{avg}(F)f \\
  m & = & \frac{\text{avg}(F)}{\text{avg}(M)}f \\
  m & = & \frac{1}{1.1} f \\
  m & = & 0.9091 f
  $$
  ​	$c \approx 0,9091$.

* **c)**  The data shows that approximately 20% of the females were virgins, while only 5% of the males were. The researcher wonders how excluding virgins from the population would change the averages. If he knew graph theory, the researcher would realize that the nonvirgin male average number of partners will be $x(f/m)$ times the nonvirgin female average number of partners. What is $x$?

  * It is 1, as the sum of degree of all virgin guys are equal to the sum of degree of all female virgin, which are both zero;

* **d)**For purposes of further research, it would be helpful to pair each female in the group with a unique male in the group. Explain why this is not possible.

  * As we have more female than males;

## Problem 2

* **a)** Prove that in every simple graph, there are an even number of vertices of odd degree. 
* **b)** Conclude that at a party where some people shake hands, the number of people who shake hands an odd number of times is an even number. 
* **c)** Call a sequence of people at the party a handshake sequence if each person in the sequence has shaken hands with the next person, if any, in the sequence.
* **d)** Suppose George was at the party and has shaken hands with an odd number of people. Explain why, starting with George, there must be a handshake sequence ending with a different person who has shaken an odd number of hands.
