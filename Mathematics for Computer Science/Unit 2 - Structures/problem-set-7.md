## Problem 1

Let $R$ and $S$ be transitive binary relations on the same set, $A$. Which of the following new relations must also be transitive? For each part, justify your answer with a brief argument if the new relation is transitive and a counterexample if it is not.

* **a)** $R^{ -1}$
  * Must also be transitive, as like the relation divides and being divisible;
* **b)** $R \cap S$
  * Not must also be transitive, as different properties can might compare different stuff;
* **c)** $ R \circ R$
  * Must also be transitive, as like the relation divides;
*  **d)** $R \circ S$
  * Not must also be transitive, as different properties can might compare different stuff;

## Problem 2

Let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be two equivalence relations on a set, $A$. Prove or give a counterexample to the claims that the following are also equivalence relations:

* **a)** $R_1 \cap R_2$
  * It is not an equivalence relations, as it not assure to keep the symmetry, reflexivity and transitivity; 
* **b)** $R_1 \cup R_2$
  * It is also equivalence relations as it keeps the symmetry, reflexivity and transitivity; 

## Problem 3

Determine which among the four graphs pictured in Figure 1 are isomorphic. 

* Isomorphic pairs:
  * 
* Nonisomorphic pairs:
  * 
* $G_1$ and $G_2$
* $G_1$ and $G_3$
* $G_1$ and $G_4$
* $G_2$ and $G_3$
* $G_2$ and $G_4$
* $G_3$ and $G_4$
