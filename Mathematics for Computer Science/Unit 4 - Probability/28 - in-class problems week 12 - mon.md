Questions available on [**MIT**](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/assets/courseware/v1/8717a06ffd5ecd5bba2c3379156a8956/asset-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019+type@asset+block/MIT6_042JS15_cp28.pdf).

## Problem 1

Let’s Make a Deal with four doors. A prize is hidden behind one of the four doors. Then the contestant picks a door. Next, the host opens an unpicked door that has no prize behind it. The contestant is allowed to stick with their original door or to switch to one of the two unopened, unpicked doors. The contestant wins if their final choice is the door hiding the prize.

Assumptions:

1. The prize is equally likely to be behind each door.
2. The contestant is equally likely to pick each door initially, regardless of the prize’s location.
3. The host is equally likely to reveal each door that does not conceal the prize and was not selected by the player.

Use The Four Step Method to find the following probabilities:

* **a)** Contestant Stu, a sanitation engineer from Trenton, New Jersey, stays with his original door. What is the probability that Stu wins the prize?

  * **Sample Space**

    * Randomly-determined quantities:
      * The door concealing the car.
      * The door initially chosen by the player.
      * The door that the host opens to reveal a goat.
      * The unused door
    * 

  * **Tree Diagram**

    (door concealing prize, door initially chosen, door opened to reveal a goat)

    

* **b)** Contestant Zelda, an alien abduction researcher from Helena, Montana, switches to one of the remaining two doors with equal probability. What is the probability that Zelda wins the prize?
