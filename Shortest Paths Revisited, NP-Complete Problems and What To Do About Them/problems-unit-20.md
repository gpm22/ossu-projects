## Test Your Understanding

### Problem 20.1

In the makespan minimization problem, suppose that jobs have similar lengths (with $\ell_j \leq 2 \ell_h$ for all jobs $j, h$) and that there is a healthy number of jobs (at least 10 times the number of machines).
What can you say about the makespan of the schedule output by the `Graham` algorithm? (Choose the strongest true statement.)
