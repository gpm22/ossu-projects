;In this problem set you will represent information about descendant family 
;trees from Harry Potter and design functions that operate on those trees.

;To make your task much easier we suggest two things:
;  - you only need a DESCENDANT family tree
;  - read through this entire problem set carefully to see what information 
;    the functions below are going to need. Design your data definitions to
;    only represent that information.
;  - you can find all the information you need by looking at the individual 
;    character pages like the one we point you to for Arthur Weasley.
