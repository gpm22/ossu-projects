## Homework Problems and Questions

### Chapter 2 Review Questions

#### SECTION 2.1

**R1. List five nonproprietary Internet applications and the application-layer protocols that they use.**

1. Web: HTTP.
2. Remote login: Telnet.
3. Network News: NNTP.
4. E-mail: SMTP, IMAP, POP3.
5. File Transfer: FTP.
6. BitTorrent File Sharing: BitTorrent Protocol.

**R2. What is the difference between network architecture and application architecture?**
**R3. For a communication session between a pair of processes, which process is the client and which is the server?**
**R4. For a P2P file-sharing application, do you agree with the statement, “There is no notion of client and server sides of a communication session”? Why or why not?**
**R5. What information is used by a process running on one host to identify a process running on another host?**
**R6. Suppose you wanted to do a transaction from a remote client to a server as fast as possible. Would you use UDP or TCP? Why?**
**R7. Referring to Figure 2.4, we see that none of the applications listed in Figure 2.4 requires both no data loss and timing. Can you conceive of an application that requires no data loss and that is also highly time-sensitive?**
**R8. List the four broad classes of services that a transport protocol can provide. For each of the service classes, indicate if either UDP or TCP (or both) provides such a service.**
**R9. Recall that TCP can be enhanced with TLS to provide process-to-process security services, including encryption. Does TLS operate at the transport layer or the application layer? If the application developer wants TCP to be enhanced with TLS, what does the developer have to do?**
