## Homework Problems and Questions

### Chapter 1 Review Questions

#### SECTION 1.1

**R1. What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?**

Host and end system are synonymous.

Types of end systems:

1. Servers
2. Mobile computers
3. Smartphones 
4. Tablets
5. Workstation
6. Fridge

A web server is indeed a end system.

**R2. The word protocol is often used to describe diplomatic relations. How does Wikipedia describe diplomatic protocol?**

As a rule which describes how to perform an certain activity. But it is also described as a set of international courtesy rules that makes it easier for nations and people to live and work together.

**R3. Why are standards important for protocols?**

Because standards allow people to create systems and products that interoperate.

#### SECTION 1.2

**R4. List four access technologies. Classify each one as home access, enterprise access, or wide-area wireless access.**

**R5. Is HFC transmission rate dedicated or shared among users? Are collisions possible in a downstream HFC channel? Why or why not?**

**R6. List the available residential access technologies in your city. For each type of access, provide the advertised downstream rate, upstream rate, and monthly price.**

**R7. What is the transmission rate of Ethernet LANs?**

**R8. What are some of the physical media that Ethernet can run over?**

**R9. HFC, DSL, and FTTH are all used for residential access. For each of these access technologies, provide a range of transmission rates and comment on whether the transmission rate is shared or dedicated.**

**R10. Describe the most popular wireless Internet access technologies today. Compare and contrast them.**

#### SECTION 1.3

**R11. Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the switch and between the switch and the receiving host are R1 and R2, respectively. Assuming that the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of length L? (Ignore queuing, propagation delay, and processing delay.)**

**R12. What advantage does a circuit-switched network have over a packet-switched network? What advantages does TDM have over FDM in a circuit-switched network?**

**R13. Suppose users share a 2 Mbps link. Also suppose each user transmits continuously at 1 Mbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 20 percent of the time.**

1. **When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported?**
2. **For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet switching is used. Why will there be essentially no queuing delay before the link if two or fewer users transmit at the same time? Why will there be a queuing delay if three users transmit at the same time?**
3. **Find the probability that a given user is transmitting. d. Suppose now there are three users. Find the probability that at any given time, all three users are transmitting simultaneously. Find the fraction of time during which the queue grows.**

**R14. Why will two ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy often peer with each other? How does an IXP earn money?**

**R15. Some content providers have created their own networks. Describe Googleâ€™s network. What motivates content providers to create these networks?**
